# RSA( Rivest – Shamir – Adleman ) Algorithm
RSA was one of the first public-key cryptographic algorithms. They enjoy widespread use in secure data transmission. This is a basic simulation of the algorithm in C++. You can find more informaton about RSA [here](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_algorithm).

### Prerequisites
1. Some basic knowledge about C++ STL(Standard Template Library). Even if you don't have any idea, don't worry( even I learnt to work with this :)).
2. In order to use this implementation, you should have Boost installed in your system. Boost is a set of libraries for the C++ programming language that provide support for tasks and structures such as linear algebra, pseudorandom number generation, multithreading, image processing, regular expressions, and unit testing( atleast that's what Wikipedia said). We mainly make use of it here to work with pretty large numbers and to deal with their operations. You can find more information about Boost [here](https://www.boost.org/). 

### How to Run
To compile:
```
g++ RSA.cpp -lcrypto
```
To Run
```
./a.out
```
